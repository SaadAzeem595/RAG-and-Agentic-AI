This can lead to unfair outcomes in areas such as hiring, lending, and criminal justice. To mitigate this risk, it is essential to ensure that AI systems are trained on diverse and representative datasets. Additionally, regular audits and transparency in AI algorithms can help identify and rectify biases.\n",

As AI systems become more powerful, they could be exploited for nefarious purposes, such as deepfakes, cyberattacks, or autonomous weapons. To address this, robust security measures must be implemented, and international regulations should be established to govern the use of AI in these contexts.\n",

    "[LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) is a powerful framework designed to simplify the development of applications powered by language models. Built to address the challenges of working with LLMs in practical settings, LangChain provides a standardized interface for connecting models with various data sources and application environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain serves as an abstraction layer, making it easier to build complex LLM applications without handling the low-level details of model interaction. This framework has become a standard tool in the LLM ecosystem, supporting a wide range of use cases from chatbots to document analysis systems.\n",

    "In this section, we'll focus on LangChain's prompt template capabilities, demonstrating how they can be used to create structured, reproducible interactions with language models across different application types.\"\n"

    "[Prompt templates](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/concepts/#prompt-templates) are a key concept in LangChain. They help translate user input and parameters into instructions for a language model. These templates can be used to guide a model's response, helping it understand the context and generate relevant and coherent language-based outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "A prompt template acts as a reusable structure for generating prompts with dynamic values. It allows you to define a consistent format while leaving placeholders for variables that change with each use case. This approach makes prompting more systematic and maintainable, especially when working with complex applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Modern LangChain (as of 2025) offers two main approaches to working with templates:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The traditional `LLMChain` approach\n",
    "- The newer LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) pattern using the pipe operator `|` for more flexible composition\n",
    "\n",
    "LCEL has become the recommended pattern for building LangChain applications as it offers better composability, clearer visualization of data flow, and more flexibility when constructing complex chains.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To use a prompt template with LCEL, you typically follow these steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Define your template with variables in curly braces `{}`\n",
    "- Create a `PromptTemplate` instance\n",
    "- Build a chain using the pipe operator `|` to connect components\n",

      "- Explanation: The user's review is overwhelmingly negative, with multiple issues highlighted. The laptop's slow performance and frequent crashes indicate significant technical problems, which are major concerns for any computing device. The keyboard malfunction after just two months of use is particularly damning, as it suggests poor build quality or reliability. The user's experience with customer service further compounds their dissatisfaction, as unhelpful support can exacerbate frustration with a faulty product. Overall, the review paints a picture of a laptop that is unreliable, poorly performing, and supported by inadequate customer service.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations on completing this lab on prompt engineering and LangChain prompt templates! You've successfully navigated from basic prompting techniques to more advanced approaches including zero-shot, one-shot, few-shot learning, as well as chain-of-thought reasoning and self-consistency prompting. You then applied these concepts practically using LangChain's prompt templates with the modern LCEL pattern to create various applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "By learning how to properly structure prompts and build composable chains with the pipe operator (`|`), you've gained essential skills for developing robust LLM applications. These techniques provide a solid foundation for creating more complex systems and getting the most out of any language model you work with.\n"
